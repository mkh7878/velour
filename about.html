                Miserable poets, legends, martyrs—Byronic darlings haunting the fringes of life—this music is for you.<br><br>
                I am a rock and roll acolyte, an outsider, and observer, always ready with a pen and paper to turn my weird thoughts into weird songs. 
                <br><br>
                I started writing songs in 2021. I was traveling across the US in my little Nissan Altima, stopping along riversides to play my Epiphone Texan guitar to the aspen trees and writing lyrics beneath starry desert skies. I serendipitously wound up in Los Angeles, and I spent nearly a year there living what felt more like a social experiment than a life. 
                <br><br>
                I began performing music a few years later, living in England, haunting the same corners of the world as many a rock n roll protagonist before me. Some of my favorite songs come from a prolific period living in Southend-on-Sea in Essex, living in a cramped attic near the seaside and writing with my unplugged red SG guitar. 
                <br><br>
                I’m realising a decade-long dream of releasing real music with my debut single Bat Country, a “hallucinatory nightmare telling the story of one woman’s journey through the fading echoes of the American Dream”.
