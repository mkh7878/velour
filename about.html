            <p style="color: white;">
                Velour is a music project founded by songwriter Mae Horak in London in 2022 and currently based in Southern California.
                <br><br>
                Velour’s songs range from the cinematic to the surreal with a through line of 90s British rock. 
                <br><br>
                Mae has performed solo shows in London and Manchester in the UK as well as in major US cities including Chicago, Boston and San Diego, sometimes solo and sometimes with other musicians.
                <br><br>
                Mae uses lyrics as a way to express complex thoughts and feelings and examine the world around her. Inspirations for song lyrics include the stories of Syd Barrett (&apos;Another Life&apos;) and Gram Parsons (“Join the 27 Club or Die Trying”) as well as the writing of Hunter S Thompson (&apos;Bat Country&apos;). She also writes more personal, emotionally driven songs such as &apos;Words Aren’t Enough&apos;, which was released into the world in demo form in 2023 and has become a staple of live shows.
                <br><br>
                She takes lyrical inspiration from the insightful observational lyrics from bands like the Manic Street Preachers and the Decemberists, as well as the poetic lyricists of artists like Ian Hunter, Marc Bolan, and Syd Barrett. She is hugely influenced by 70’s rock n roll, specifically T-Rex, The Faces and the Stones. However, it was 80s/90s british groups such as Pulp, Oasis, Stone Roses, the Smiths and the Stereophonics that made playing music seem more accessible for an &apos;everyday&apos; person. 
                <br><br>
                Mae composed the score to film “Bat Country” produced by <a href="offhandco.com" target="_blank" style="color: #34BFBA;">Off Hand Co </a> and making it’s way round the festival circuit starting in September 2024 and has been nominated for best short film at AFF in Buffalo, NY. 
                <br><br>
                Velour will be releasing studio recordings of songs in early 2025.
