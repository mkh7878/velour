                <h1> Bat Country<br><br></h1>
                <p><strong>V1</strong><br>
                    A generation lost and smoke<br>
                    Drunkenly inspired<br>
                    Refugees of ugly love<br>
                    Built our funeral pyres</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V2</strong><br>
                    A I one-way trip<br>
                    A disillusioned game<br>
                    Drugs can only echo<br>
                    It’s never been the same</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>CHORUS</strong><br>
                    Cars and ugly faces on the run<br>
                    Shoes they melt like<br>
                    Dreams in the Vegas sun<br>
                    And I’ve got no sympathy<br>
                    For the devil<br>
                    I’ve got no sympathy for you</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V3</strong><br>
                    The decades come faster<br>
                    Give a part I didn’t ask for<br>
                    In the decline<br>
                    Of the dreams they bastardised</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V4</strong><br>
                    You’ve got no manifesto<br>
                    Join in fake a smile<br>
                    Stop pretending to be<br>
                    Anything but hollow</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>BRIDGE</strong><br>
                    Tune in, freak out<br>
                    Get lost, fall down<br>
                    But the ticket, take the ride<br>
                    It’s all in your mind</p>

                <p><br><strong>V1</strong><br>
                    Pacify your fragile mind<br>
                    With perforated paper lines<br>
                    The colours wash away in the shadow of your smile<br>
                    You'll be fine, just close your eyes</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V2</strong><br>
                    Electrify your nursery rhymes<br>
                    Are you alone, are you alive?<br>
                    In the fraying tapestries of your tangled arteries<br>
                    Are you sure, have a little more</p>
                    
                    <p class="chorus"><strong>CHORUS</strong><br>
                    Tolerate, you can not take it with you when you go<br>
                    Saturate your echoed fate<br>
                    You can sing the blues next time<br>

                    Rest your head now on the floor<br>
                    Painted in your frozen time<br>
                    A place where you won't sleep tonight<br>
                    You'll be fine, just close your eyes</p>

                <p><strong>V1</strong><br>
                    The animal inside has closed its eyes<br>
                    But will I cease to be without the fire<br>
                    But in symmetry is sympathy<br>
                    Inheritance can't lie<br>
                    And I've lived a fantasy<br>
                    Most of my life</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V2</strong><br>
                    Everyone is hungry I can see it in their eyes<br>
                    So I must settle for a false compromise<br>
                    Framed by insignificance<br>
                    It's different in my mind<br>
                    Vanity and confidence<br>
                    Comes at a price</p>
                    
                    <p class="chorus"><strong>CHORUS</strong><br>
                    I don't mean half of what I say<br>
                    If I was invisible maybe then I'd stay<br>
                    Please forgive my inconsistencies<br>
                    I'm not gilded gold<br>
                    I'm somewhere in between</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V3</strong><br>
                    I sit alone building broken things<br>
                    All of my memories played on six strings<br>
                    An antidote to every vice<br>
                    Sanity by candlelight<br>
                    Handpicked innocence<br>
                    Won't die without a fight</p>

                    For anything worthwhile up against my heavy hand<br>
                    Brothers in another life<br>
                    Ripped and wretched every time<br>
                    How can I make this right<br>
                    Reborn too many times</p>

                    Ooo there's smoke in the air<br>
                    Ooo I can see it from here<br>
                    Through the telephone wires<br>
                    We fight fire with fire<br>
                    But you can fall apart if you want<br>
                    It won't be long…</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>CHORUS</strong><br>
                    And I know that we'll never die<br>
                    If you take yours, I'll take mine<br>
                    So never go, even when we're far away<br>
                    Won't fade away</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V3</strong><br>
                    Hey you, you gotta keep it together<br>
                    Hold your head high, they'll never sever<br>
                    Your mind from your soul<br>
                    From the sweet rock and roll in your heart<br>
                    You're free to go, you have been from the start</p>
