                <p><strong>V1</strong><br>
                    A generation lost and smoke<br>
                    Drunkenly inspired<br>
                    Refugees of ugly love<br>
                    Built our funeral pyres</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V2</strong><br>
                    A I one-way trip<br>
                    A disillusioned game<br>
                    Drugs can only echo<br>
                    It’s never been the same</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>CHORUS</strong><br>
                    Cars and ugly faces on the run<br>
                    Shoes they melt like<br>
                    Dreams in the Vegas sun<br>
                    And I’ve got no sympathy<br>
                    For the devil<br>
                    I’ve got no sympathy for you</p>

                    The decades come faster<br>
                    Give a part I didn’t ask for<br>
                    In the decline<br>
                    Of the dreams they bastardised</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V4</strong><br>
                    You’ve got no manifesto<br>
                    Join in fake a smile<br>
                    Stop pretending to be<br>
                    Anything but hollow</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>BRIDGE</strong><br>
                    Tune in, freak out<br>
                    Get lost, fall down<br>
                    But the ticket, take the ride<br>
                    It’s all in your mind</p>

                    But will I cease to be without the fire<br>
                    But in symmetry is sympathy<br>
                    Inheritance can't lie<br>

                    Framed by insignificance<br>
                    It's different in my mind<br>

                    All of my memories played on six strings<br>
                    An antidote to every vice<br>
                    Sanity by candlelight<br>

                    Brothers in another life<br>

                <p><strong>V1</strong><br>
                    Hey you, you got the world on your shoulder<br>
                    Hey now, you're just getting older<br>
                    I won't hold it forever but I'll take it for the night<br>
                    You're so lost but wherever you go is alright</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V2</strong><br>
                    Hey you, it's never been easy<br>
                    What they don't tell you is that you'll never please them<br>
                    So stop and breathe for an hour<br>
                    Won't you stay here all night<br>
                    Let it all go, lose your control, it's all right</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>PRE CHORUS</strong><br>
                    Ooo there's smoke in the air<br>
                    Ooo I can see it from here<br>
                    Through the telephone wires<br>
                    We fight fire with fire<br>
                    But you can fall apart if you want<br>
                    It won't be long…</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>CHORUS</strong><br>
                    And I know that we'll never die<br>
                    If you take yours, I'll take mine<br>
                    So never go, even when we're far away<br>
                    Won't fade away</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>V3</strong><br>
                    Hey you, you gotta keep it together<br>
                    Hold your head high, they'll never sever<br>
                    Your mind from your soul<br>
                    From the sweet rock and roll in your heart<br>
                    You're free to go, you have been from the start</p>
